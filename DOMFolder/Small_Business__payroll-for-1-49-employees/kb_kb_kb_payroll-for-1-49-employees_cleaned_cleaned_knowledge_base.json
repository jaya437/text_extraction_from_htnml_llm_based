As a partner, ADP has given him back the time and freedom needed to focus on business growth, which he considers invaluable. Shalena Brown-Best, Owner and CEO of Elements Massage, emphasizes her appreciation for RUN's simplicity in processing payroll, which removes weekly concerns and stress. She particularly values RUN's phenomenal tools and resources that help solve problems quickly whenever issues arise, making small business ownership significantly easier. Mark Picillo, General Manager of United Check Cashing, praises RUN's platform for being very intuitive and easy to use, noting that he can handle almost everything independently while still having access to ADP's excellent customer service for prompt assistance when needed.

      "summary": "Comprehensive answers to frequently asked questions about small business payroll costs, software, setup, and services.",
      "content": "Small business owners commonly have questions about payroll costs, software affordability, and implementation. The cost of small business payroll depends on several factors, including payroll frequency, total number of employees and the specific services needed, with most solutions featuring a per-payroll processing fee. ADP offers an affordable solution starting at $39 per month plus $5 per employee for basic payroll, taxes and compliance support. While some small business owners initially manage payroll themselves, many eventually turn to payroll service providers due to the time requirements and potential costly penalties from mistakes. Running small business payroll involves tracking employee hours, calculating wages and withholdings, distributing wages, depositing taxes with government agencies, filing returns, and sending required tax forms. Quality payroll software typically includes device-agnostic processing capabilities, automated tax calculations and filing, employee self-service options, error-flagging technology, and specialized compliance support. The primary benefits include significant time savings, ensuring accurate and timely employee payments, and allowing business owners to focus on revenue-generating activities. By minimizing payroll errors and automating processes, payroll software can actually save money through reduced labor expenses and avoided tax penalties. ADP provides payroll services in all 50 states and offers a straightforward setup process requiring payroll records and IRS Form 8655 completion. The platform handles hours calculation, deduction processing, wage distribution, tax filing, and secure record storage, with flexible payroll frequency options based on industry and state regulations. Employees can access pay statements electronically where permitted, and employee self-service features allow them to update contact information and manage withholdings. ADP also creates and files W-2 and 1099 forms directly with the IRS on behalf of clients.",
