### Small business payroll FAQs

**How much does small business payroll cost?**
The cost of small business payroll depends on several factors, including payroll frequency, total number of employees and the specific services that are needed. Most commonly, there is a per-payroll processing fee. The important thing to remember is that a payroll service may actually save you money when compared to the cost of tax penalties. ADP will work with you to determine the right payroll setup for your business, whether you have just one employee or several.

**Is small business payroll software affordable?**
Yes, ADP offers an affordable solution for small businesses in need of basic payroll, taxes and help with compliance they can trust. It starts at the low-cost price of $39 per month, plus $5 per employee.

**Who does payroll for a small business?**
In some small businesses, especially those in their infancy, the owner manages the payroll. However, this approach can quickly become unfeasible due to the amount of time it takes to manually process payroll and the costly penalties that can possibly ensue if mistakes are made. Consequently, many small business owners eventually turn to a payroll service provider for assistance.

**How do small businesses run payroll?**
Whether you choose to tackle the job on your own or work with a professional, running small business payroll, in its most basic form, consists of these steps: Track and record employee hours worked, calculate wages and withholding amounts (taxes, benefits, etc.), distribute wages to employees, deposit the withheld taxes with appropriate government agencies, file employer tax returns at the applicable deadlines, and send employees Form W-2 and other required tax forms. Throughout each stage of this process, you'll need to comply with constantly changing regulations – a task that can be difficult without the expertise and assistance of a payroll provider like ADP.

**What does payroll software for small business include?**
Depending on the provider's capabilities, small business payroll software may include the ability to process payroll from any device, anywhere; taxes calculated, paid and filed on your behalf with proper authorization; employee self-service and flexible payment options; intelligent technology that helps flag potential errors; and specialized support navigating some laws and regulations.

**What are the benefits of using small business payroll software?**
Saving time is one of the primary reasons small businesses use payroll software. It also provides peace of mind that employees will be paid quickly and accurately via their preferred method of payment. As a result, you can focus more attention on improving your product or service, growing your customer base, and other initiatives that generate revenue.

**Does small business payroll software save your business money?**
Tax penalties and fines resulting from payroll errors can be expensive. By helping minimize or eliminate these mistakes, payroll software may save you money. Software also automates the payroll process, which may reduce labor expenses associated with running payroll.

**Do you offer payroll in my state?**
Yes, ADP offers payroll services in all 50 states. So, whether your business is based on the East Coast, West Coast, Midwest or one of the noncontiguous states, we've got you covered.

**How do I get set up on ADP?**
You can be set up on ADP's small business payroll in two easy steps: Provide us with your payroll records, including information about your company, your employees and their jobs, and state and local regulations. Then notify the IRS that you've chosen to work with ADP as your payroll service by completing Form 8655, Reporting Agent Authorization.

**What are all the things I can do with ADP payroll?**
ADP's small business payroll is automated, which means there's minimal effort needed on your part. Here are some of the things our payroll service handles behind the scenes: Calculate hours worked and gross pay, process payroll deductions including taxes, benefits, garnishments, etc., calculate net wages and pay employees, file tax reports with federal, state and local government agencies, and document and store payroll records securely.

**How many times can I run payroll per month?**
The frequency with which you can run payroll depends on your industry and state regulations. ADP generally recommends weekly or biweekly pay periods where acceptable. We'll work with you to create a payroll calendar that suits your business and compliance needs.

**How will my employees get their paystubs?**
Depending on your state's regulations, your employees may be able to access their pay statements electronically. Or, you may be required to provide them with printed pay statements. ADP's small business payroll supports both versions.

**What's included in employee accounts?**
Employee self-service is included with ADP's small business payroll. After logging into their account, your employees can access their pay statements, update their contact information and manage their withholdings.

**Does ADP file Form W-2 and Form 1099?**
We'll create and deliver W-2 and 1099 forms for you, and even e-file these forms with the IRS on your behalf.
